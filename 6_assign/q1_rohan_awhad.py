"""
[K-means clustering (hard) via Lloyd Algorithm - 60pt] Implement the Lloyd Algorithm which
uses iterative approach to obtain heuristic-based solutions for K-mean clustering. Recall that Lloyd
algorithm uses two steps: (1) centers-to-clusters and (2) clusters-to-centers iteratively until
convergence. Assume that the algorithm has converged if the centers do not change between iterations.

> Input: The first line contains two integers k and m where k is the number of clusters, and m is the
number of dimensions for given data points. Each subsequent line contains ordered m numbers where
each representing a coordinate value for a dimension of a data point in Euclidean space.

> Output: k centers obtained from running Lloyd algorithm â€“ k lines (one for each center), each con-
taining m coordinate values for the center
